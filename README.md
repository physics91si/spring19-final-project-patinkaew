# Anime Data from MyAnimeList

My project has two main parts: data analysis and recommender system.
For the data analysis part, I analyze various aspects of the data set we have.
For example, the number of anime per year and trend in anime genre. I also try to evaluate efficiency of the anime studios.

For the second part, I make a recommender system. User could put an anime name and the recommender will give the top ten
similar anime to the given title. There are also autocorrect feature for recommender system.
